# E-commerce Product Listing Page

This project is a simple e-commerce product listing page built using **React**. It features a product grid, a search bar, pagination, and a modal for adding products to the cart. Additionally, when users click on the "View Product" button, they are redirected to a "Thank You" page. The project is based on a Figma design provided for a React Developer Interview Assignment.

## Features

- **Product Listing**: Displays products in a responsive grid layout.
- **Search Bar**: Allows users to search for products.
- **Product Cards**: Each card shows a product image, name, price, and buttons to either view the product or add it to the cart.
- **Modal**: Opens when a user clicks the "Add to Cart" button, showing product details and a confirmation button.
- **Thank You Page**: A simple page displayed when users click "View Product".
- **Pagination**: Simulated pagination to navigate through multiple pages of products.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes including mobile, tablet, and desktop.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **CSS (Flexbox, Grid, Media Queries)**: For styling and responsiveness.
- **React Router**: For handling navigation between the product listing page and the Thank You page.
- **Mock Data**: Used for displaying the list of products (no backend/API required).
